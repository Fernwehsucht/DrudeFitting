# DrudeFitting
Fitting optical spectroscopy data with complex Drude or Lorentzians.

Least squaured fitting simultaneously dealing with the real and imagninary parts of the conductivity data. 

Weight can be assigned to different frequency points of either the real and imaginary part. 

Requires initial guess of the parameters, which can be obtained from e.g. Reffit. 

Saves data and generates preview figures automatically.
